# Deep_Learning_HW_Submission

HOMEWORK - 1:
------------
I trained my model ( Featurer Extractor(CNN) + Classifier(ANN) ) on subset of a very famous data name Fashion MNIST due to unavailiabilty of NVIDIA GPU on my device I achived accurecy of 86.41% even on small set. I belive if you run this model on full data that I already uploded with small one then model will achive accurecy upto 91 or 92% I tried my best to reduce overfitting as well.
